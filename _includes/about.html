 <p> I am currently a postdoc in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota working on aerosol deposition of thermoelectric thin films. The focus of the research is to develop a scalable additive manufacturing technique that can produce large-area thin films via supersonic impaction.</p>
		    <p> My prior research focus during Ph. D. was in the field of flexible and printable electronics. It spanned from developing the chemistry and engineer the hardware technologies enabling microplasma patterned direct-write on flexible thin films and develop precursors for inkjet printing of metallic nanoparticles. During Ph. D. I have also worked on plasma-electrochemical reactions to form metal nanoparticles in solutions and plasma-gas phase reactions to synthesize aerosols.

		    <p> I received my PhD in Chemical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University in 2017. My advisor was <a href="http://engineering.case.edu/profiles/rxs192">Professor R. Mohan Sankaran</a>. I also have a M.Tech degree in Materials Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur and a M.S. degree in Physics from the Bose Institute in Kolkata.

		    <p>My research has been recognized by the American Vacuum Society (AVS) and Electrostatics Society of America (ESA), including the <a href="http://thedaily.case.edu/engineering-phd-student-wins-award-work-plasma-science-technology/">2016 Coburn and Winters Student Award in Plasma Technology</a>.

<p> I enjoy visualizing and expressing my work in the form of 3D models and process flow schematics. My 3D images are rendered using various visualization softwares including, but not limited to Autodesk 3Ds Max, Adobe Photoshop, ChemDraw and SolidWorks. Some of my renditions have been featured on dustflap of  Nature Communications, the Journal of Vaccum Science and Technology-A, and the cover of Journal of Physics D.
