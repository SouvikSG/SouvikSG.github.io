<h2>Additive Manufacturing via Supersonic Aerosol Impaction</h2>
			
<p>Ball milling is a well-established inductrial technique that is implemented for large scale powder synthesis from bulk ingots. We implement this cheap and scalable method to synthesize sub-1000 nm particles dispersed in a solution. When this colloidal dispersion is nebulized, we can create large volumes of dense, dry aerosols.</p>

<p>Considerable amount of efforts were put towards design of a converging-diverging de Laval nozzle. Downstream of the nozzle is pumped to high vacuum, enabling upstream-to-downstream pressure ratio as high of 100. This pressure differential across the nozzle accelerates the flowing gas close to mach 6. Subsequently, the aerosol flowing through the nozzle is impacted on the substrate. High kinetic energy of the aerosol during impactiong leads to melting and solidification, thus creating a sintered thin film.</p>
                
<h2>Non-Lithographic Surface Modification</h2>

<p>Plasmas are an essential component used for traditional top-down fabrication of integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing for etching and deposition of thin films.</p>

<p>Microplasmas are a different class of plasmas that can form at atmospheric-pressure and are a localized source of electrons, ions, and radicals. They are formed under non-equillibrium conditions and can be used to selectively modify thin films.</p>

<p>My work reflects the use of an atmospheric-pressure DC microplasma as a tool to direct-write patterns of metalic features <i>in situ</i> at the surface of a polymer thin film. We have been able to successfully demostrate a high degree of conductivity of these structures. Further, we discovered and reported for the first time electrodiffusion as a fundamental mechanism for the formation of these meatallic features at the surface of the polymers.</p>

<p>My work involves analyzing the degree of flexibility and stretchability of these films and engineering methodologies to improve them. Additionally, efforts are also being put towards reducing the feature sizes.</p>

<h2>Plasma-liquid Electrochemistry</h2>

<p> Non-equillibrium plasmas have previously been formed at the surface of ionic liquids. As an alternative approach to fabricate metallic structures on flexible thin films with high throughput, we developed a continuous nanoparticle synthesis apparatus using an atmospheric-pressure microplasma as a tool.</p>

<p> Unlike a conventional batch system, the electrolyte is flown between the microplasma cathode and a platinum anode, both the electronics of which are isolated from the rest of the system. We have been successful in using this system to manufacture high density silver nanoparticles in water at the rate of 10 - 20 mL/min. I am working on developing a new chemistry to synthesize other noble, alloy or semi-conducting nanoparticles using this setup.</p>

<p> In a more traditional electrochemical synthesis approach, we have also implemented an atmospheric-pressure DC microplasma as a cathode for material synthesis. We demonstrated fundamental understanding of solvated electron and dissolved hydrogen atom mediated material reduction. These materials ranged from metal ions such as silver, gold, zinc and copper to gasseous molecules such as nitrogen and its oxides.</p>
